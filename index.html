                <h3>1. Pick your destination</h3>
                <p>If you are wondering how to plan a trip with friends or family than you should probably start from either some stunning pics that gone viral on social media, the scenic setting of a movie, or an irresistible story of a friend’s last trip abroad. Touring plans, more often than not, are triggered by external factors.

                <h4>Things to keep in mind before selecting a destination
                </h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Consider the cost factor while picking a destination. Some places are more enjoyable in a luxury budget than others. Going to a luxury destination during the shoulder season (a few weeks before or after the official ‘busy season’) can result in some good discounts on hotels and flights.

                        Ease of accessibility or lack thereof is also a factor that can sway the decision of visiting a destination or not. Generally, the popular destinations have a lot of daily flights, trains, and good highway infrastructure to support the tourist influx.</li>

                <h3>2. Decide the duration of your trip</h3>
                <p>There is a fine line between getting bored and enjoying every moment at a destination. However, no destination has a predefined ideal duration. Wondering how to plan your road trip? It often depends on the touring plans and purpose of the visit of the travelers.

                <h4>Things to keep in mind before deciding the duration of a trip</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A key aspect of a good trip planner is to correctly estimate the number of days required to visit a destination. A road trip planner would elongate the duration of a trip whereas, a trip planned with flight tickets could be a little shorter.
                    </li>
                    <li>Trips, where the destination is within 8 hours, can also be done on a weekend provided that the night time is utilized for traveling.
                    </li>
                    <li>A trip with a lot of urban destinations will need more time in the sightseeing, and therefore a longer trip duration. Whereas a trip to a tropical beach town would not involve much sightseeing and hence, the duration can be shorter.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is advisable to keep a vacant day in touring plans that exceed 7 days. This gives a buffer to things like flight/train delays, traffic jams, weather hold-ups, or a change-of-heart to extend one’s stay at a particular destination.
                    </li>
                </ul>
